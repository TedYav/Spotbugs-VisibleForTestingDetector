    <ShortDescription>Visible for Testing Invocation Plugin</ShortDescription>
    <Details>This plugin checks that all methods annotated with @VisibleForTesting are only called within their declaring class, or in test code. Any other usages will cause errors. This allows developers to safely expose methods as package-private for testing purposes, while ensuring that incorrect usages of these methods will break a build.</Details>

    <ShortDescription>Invalid invocation of @VisibleForTesting method.</ShortDescription>
    <LongDescription>
      @VisibleForTesting is supposed to be used to make private methods package-private for writing test cases. As such, such methods should be called only within the class in which they are declared, or in a test class. This plugin assumes that a test class will be named xxTest. To remove this error, ensure you are only using the flagged method within its declare class or in test code, or remove the annotation.
